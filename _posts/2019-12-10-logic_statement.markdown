# **A logic statement or operation can be evaluated to be True or False. The logic statement is an instruction that is either going to evaluate to True or False all depend on what the condition state. A common example is writing a program asking a robot to move. What determined the movement of such a robot is if the condition is meant True otherwise is never going to move if is not True(Aka false). The importance of logic in coding is to change the sequential order of coding also to enable decision making on how the code is going to be structured to meet the requirement of what the code should do.**
