 ## Setup of my cli project 
****  Well, I was able to install a gem command bundle to install my binary folder and library also gemfile.
In my binary folder, there is a console file that was generated after running the bundle gem command. In this console file, I went ahead to required environment file which is created in my config folder also went ahead to create an instance of my command line interface which is for CLI, where I wrote my codes
also in environment file, this is where all my library file is required as well as my gems example nokogiri, binding pry, and open URI gem.
In my library file consist of three files, scraper file,CLI file, and game file.
