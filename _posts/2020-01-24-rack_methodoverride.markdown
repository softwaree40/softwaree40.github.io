If you’re working through all the hope and doubt and strategies it takes to become a full-stack developer, then you’re going to enjoy the bejeezus out of this episode. Tody i understand what coding is all about when i started coding one big challenge i had was how i can structure my code how to get organize even though i still have a lot to learn. My Sinatra project actually makes me understand a lot about how the thing works example...the Rack middleware how possible it is used to force the HTTP verb Post to patch. Rack MethodOverride is a gem that enables the "PATCH/PUT" Verb to override the POST HTTP Verb. Rack middleware is a way to filter a request and response coming into your application. A middleware component sits between the client and the server, processing inbound requests and outbound responses, but it's more than an interface that can be used to talk to a web server. It’s used to group and order modules, which are usually Ruby classes, and specify the dependency between them. Rack middleware module must only. So if your dream is to be a full-stack developer and you need a bit of guidance and motivation to get there, then this blogs is for you!
