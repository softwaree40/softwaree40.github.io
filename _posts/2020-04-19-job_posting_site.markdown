**I was happy having an authentication implementation which requires omniauth Gem to be added to my project.

    It also brought in a set of new gems into our dependency tree. I’d rather keep our codebases as slim as possible.
		
I am trying to find an app that I cared enough about that will put things together, that would bring purpose to my 
project.This was a very difficult task to completion.
It took me some time and thinking on how to go about coding,    but i am so amaze that i could finish the project.I was 
motivated by my cohort leader.
I give Kudos to him for all his support, even though so many times i message him he responded quickly, that was a great motivation to do better on my next project.
Rails makes it so easy to spike up a good CRUD interface. this make  it’s easier to build simpler features into the existing applications.
I added some logic to show a featured job post and a featured attachment per post. By the end of the day i had a working job posting site with a simple implementation that could be easier and useful for our employers and employees.**
